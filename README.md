# Implementation Details
<!-- Provide a short description of your implementation (technologies used, brief overview of project architecture, etc.) -->
The URL shortener is implemented in Next.js (React) and TypeScript. The project was initialized as suggested by the Next.js team using the following command: `npx create-next-app@latest --use-yarn`.

The project is comprised of 3 basic building blocks:
1. Page UI
2. URL Shortening API
3. Routing Middleware

# How to Run
<!--
- Include instructions on how to run your implementation locally. Be sure to include any necessary setup steps, such as installing dependencies, as well as the commands to start the application.
-->
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `yarn install` in the project root
3. Run `yarn build` in the project root
4. Run `yarn start` in the project root
5. Visit the URL output in the terminal, which should be [https://localhost:3000]()

# Testing
<!-- Describe how you tested your solution (automated testing, manual testing process, screenshots, etc.) -->

# Tools Used
<!--
- Describe any tools you used in developing your solution (e.g. ChatGPT for generating ideas and styles)
- Note: The use of AI tools is not discouraged, but they should be used judiciously.

I have the Github Copilot extension installed in my IDE. I used some autocomplete features and no chat features. I prompted Meta's Llama 3 with some questions around Next.js middlewares and API routes, but generally found the official Next.js [docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) more helpful.
